# Remarks

The first part was quite trivial to quickly solve using the modulo operator. The second part seemed really simple at first, but there are some tricky edge cases when attempting the modulo approach. After trying for quite some time, I decided to solve the problem the "dumb" way by just emulating the rotating safe disk with a for loop. Slow but works.
