# Remarks

Part 1 was trivial compared to yesterdays. Just some basic regex gymnastics. Part 2 as also not too difficult once I figured out the proper parsing schema. I did get to use the `reduce` function which I did not use in a while. Honestly, today's problem was not that intellectually stimulating and a bit of rote programming.
