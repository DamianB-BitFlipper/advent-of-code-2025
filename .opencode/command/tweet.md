description: Generate a tweet for an AoC day
---

Generate a tweet for Advent of Code 2025 Day $1.

Read the REMARKS.md file at day$1/REMARKS.md to understand:
- How long it took (the `time` frontmatter field, in minutes)
- How many lines of code (the `loc` frontmatter field)
- Any interesting observations or struggles

Read the solution code in day$1/ to identify the core algorithm or approach used.

Write a single tweet (under 280 chars) that:
- Mentions it's AoC 2025 Day $1
- Has a brief, punchy tagline about the algorithm/approach (e.g. "brute force wins again", "modular arithmetic gone wrong", "regex to the rescue")
- Includes time and LOC stats naturally
- Ends with the solution link: https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/advent-of-code-2025/tree/main/day$1

Do NOT:
- Use hashtags
- Sound enthusiastic or salesy
- Use words like "excited", "amazing", "journey", "dive in"
- Use emojis

Output ONLY the tweet text, nothing else.
