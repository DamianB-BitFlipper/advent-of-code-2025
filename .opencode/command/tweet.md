description: Generate a tweet for an AoC day
---

Generate a tweet for Advent of Code 2025 Day $1.

Read the REMARKS.md file at day$1/REMARKS.md to understand:
- How long it took (the `time` frontmatter field, in minutes)
- How many lines of code (the `loc` frontmatter field)
- Any interesting observations or struggles

Read the solution code in day$1/ to identify the core algorithm or approach used.

Write a single tweet (under 280 chars) that:
- Mentions it's AoC 2025 Day $1
- Uses a casual, first-person tone reflecting your actual experience from REMARKS.md (e.g., "was pretty easy", "this one took a while", "honestly expected worse")
- Briefly names the general approach in plain language (e.g., "grid sweeps", "string parsing", "BFS") without overexplaining
- References how this day compared to previous days if mentioned in remarks
- Includes time and LOC stats naturally at the end
- Ends with the solution link on its own line: https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/advent-of-code-2025/tree/main/day$1

Do NOT:
- Use hashtags
- Sound enthusiastic or salesy
- Use words like "excited", "amazing", "journey", "dive in"
- Use emojis
- Use algorithmic jargon or overly technical taglines

Before outputting the final tweet, reason through:
1. What was the author's actual experience/feeling from REMARKS.md?
2. How did this day compare to previous days (if mentioned)?
3. Draft 2-3 tweet variations with different casual phrasings
4. Evaluate each variation for character count and natural tone

Finally, output the best tweet clearly labeled as "Suggested tweet:" followed by just the tweet text.
