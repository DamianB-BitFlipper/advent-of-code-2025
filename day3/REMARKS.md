# Remarks

This problem was really tricky. The first case with only two batteries was quite trivial to implement with two nested for loops. However for 12 batteries, rather than having 12 nested loops, which may have been too computationally slow, I had to implement a linearized stack for backtracking. I really had to stop and think on this problem! Would make for a great interview question/brainteaser.
